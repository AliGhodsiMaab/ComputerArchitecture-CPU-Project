# Computer Architecture Course Project  
### Designing and Implementing a Hypothetical CPU

## Introduction  
Welcome!  
This is the final project for our **Computer Architecture** course, where we designed and implemented a **hypothetical CPU** in two main phases. The project includes various design files, simulation code, and documentation to help understand how a CPU works internally.

---

## Phase 1: Initial Design  
In the first phase, we focused on designing the basic components of the CPU. This phase includes:

- ✅ Verilog (or VHDL) files for:
  - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**
  - **Control Unit**
  - **Testbenches** to verify correctness

- ✅ Logisim files for:
  - **Register File**
  - **ALU**
  - **Control Unit**

- A PDF document containing:
  - The **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** of our CPU
  - A list of all defined **operations (OPs)** and their instruction formats

> ⚠️ Please make sure you have the necessary software installed to open **Verilog/VHDL** and **Logisim** files (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado, or Logisim Evolution).

---

## Phase 2: Complete CPU Implementation  
In the second phase, we fully implemented the CPU with all required components and data path.

This phase includes:

- **Logisim** files of the final working CPU, uploaded as a ZIP archive
- All **Verilog** files used in the project (along with their testbenches), also provided as a ZIP archive
- A custom **Assembler** script designed specifically for our CPU architecture

---

## Purpose of the Project  
The goal of this project was to help us better understand how CPUs work at the microarchitectural level.  
If you haven’t yet taken this course, exploring this project can give you valuable insights into instruction execution, data path design, and CPU control logic.

## Notes  
To run the files successfully:

- Use tools such as **ModelSim** or **Vivado** for Verilog/VHDL simulations
- Use **Logisim Evolution** for circuit designs

## We hope this project helps you in your learning journey.  
### Best of luck!
